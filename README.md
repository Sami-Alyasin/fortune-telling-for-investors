# Fortune Telling For Investors

## Overview

This is an end-to-end data science project that will deploy a predictive model and explore how the amount of data collected, engineered features used, models selected, and the selection of the parameters of those models contribute to the accuracy and efficiency of the stock price predictive model. The model will generate the next trading day's prediction for the selected stock's adjusted closing price. 

This project will cover the following steps:
  1. **Data collection** - We will collect historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance API.
  2. **Exploratory data analysis (EDA)** - We will explore the historical stock price data to understand the patterns and trends.
  3. **Feature engineering** - We will create new features from the historical stock price data to help predict the stock price movement.
  4. **Modeling** - We will train, optimize, and evaluate a variety of machine learning models.
  5. **Model deployment** - Finally, we will deploy the best performing model as a web application using Streamlit.
